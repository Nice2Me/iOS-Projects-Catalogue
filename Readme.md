# iOS Projects Catalogue

This is the catalogue of iOS/Objective-C Open Source projects. I created it to have a fast access to any Mac/iOS-related projects I recently Github-starred or explored.

It will grow as fast as it is possible with my ability to add/explore new projects around the net, Github, etc.

You may start watching this repo to receive notifications about new incoming projects. New projects are added via Pull Requests to 'new' branch so all watchers of this repository receive corresponding email notifications.

Feel free to suggest any new projects that are not present in the current list. See [Contribution](https://github.com/stanislaw/iOS-Projects-Catalogue/blob/master/Contribution.md).

Note! This catalogue also includes a number of projects that are not open-source but are still somehow related to iOS/OSX applications development.

Suggestions are welcome! New projects are welcome!
